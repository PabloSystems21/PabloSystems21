👋 Hi, my name is Pablo Rodriguez Gonzalez, a Mexican systems engineering student aspiring to become a professional full-stack developer.

👀 I’m interested in full-stack coding, and I'm always eager to learn new skills.

🌱 I’m currently learning to become a full-stack programmer and preparing myself to be proficient in native development for projects that require it.

💞️ I’m open to collaborating on various web, app, or backend projects. If there's anything I can assist you with, please feel free to reach out.

📫 You can contact me via my personal developer email: ing.gonzalez.systems@gmail.com

⚡  Fun fact: In my free time, I love playing video games and delving into the intricacies of game design. I often find myself pondering the
creative decisions made by developers, imagining the thought processes behind each unique aspect of the game world.
